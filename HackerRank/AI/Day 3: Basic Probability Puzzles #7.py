Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

Task
A firm produces steel pipes in three plants.

Plant A produces 500 units per day and
has a fraction defective output of 0.005.
Plant B produces 1000 units per day and
has a fraction defective output of 0.008.
Plant C produces 2000 units per day and
has a fraction defective output of 0.010.
At random, a pipe is selected from the dayâ€™s total production
and it is found to be defective.
What is the probability that it came from plant A?
