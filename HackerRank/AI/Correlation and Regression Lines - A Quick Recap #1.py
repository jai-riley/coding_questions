Here are the test scores of 10 students in physics and history:

Physics Scores  15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3
History Scores  10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15
Compute Karl Pearsonâ€™s coefficient of correlation between these scores.
Compute the answer correct to three decimal places.
